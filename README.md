# Learning Management System (LMS)

This is my final project for PLP Africa, built using Node.js and Express. The LMS platform is designed to support educators and students by providing a seamless way to upload and access educational materials. The project aligns with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education), promoting inclusive and equitable learning opportunities for all.

# Key Features:
* Teacher file uploads (PDFs, docs, videos, etc.)
* Student access to reading materials.
* Node.js with MySQL integration for data management.
* RESTful API with endpoints for managing educational resources.
